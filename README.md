There is Plenty of Room at the Bottom
    theres-plenty-of-room-at-the-bottom
    synopsis
        a simulation of nanotechnology
        design, calculation, criticism, and redesign
        make our mistakes in thought rather than deed
        projections regarding molecular machines as accurate as those Leonardo da Vinci made regarding metal machines
        generation and testing of alternatives
        grow spaceships from soil, air, and sunlight
        automated engineering
